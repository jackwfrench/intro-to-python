    "## Introduction to OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition and Importance of OOP\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of \"objects\". These objects can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. Unlike procedural programming, which structures programs as sequences of instructions, OOP structures programs as collections of objects that can communicate and interact. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex, and actively updated or maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP has become a fundamental part of modern software development due to its ability to encapsulate data and operations on data in objects, making it easier to structure and maintain complex programs. OOP principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation allow for code reuse and design patterns, leading to more efficient and manageable codebases. It supports modularity and scalability, making it easier to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, inter-operable objects. OOP languages, like Java, C++, and Python, are widely used in various applications ranging from web and mobile apps to game development and scientific computing, underlining the paradigm's versatility and adaptability in the ever-evolving tech landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brief History of OOP\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) evolved as a response to the increasing complexity of software systems. In the early days of programming, procedural approaches were common, but they often led to issues like code duplication and difficulty in managing large codebases. The concept of organizing software around data structures and the operations that can be performed on them led to the development of OOP. The key idea was to bundle data and the methods that operate on the data into one unit, known as an object, making it easier to track and manage related functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simula (1960s)**: Often regarded as the first object-oriented programming language, Simula introduced key concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and dynamic binding.\n",
    "- **Smalltalk (1970s)**: This language further popularized OOP and introduced the concept of message passing, an important aspect of OOP in terms of object interaction.\n",
    "- **C++ (1980s)**: Developed as an extension of the C language, C++ added object-oriented features to a widely used programming language, significantly boosting the popularity of OOP.\n",
    "- **Java (1990s)**: Designed with a focus on portability across platforms, Java's \"Write Once, Run Anywhere\" philosophy and its robust OOP capabilities made it a staple in enterprise software development.\n",
    "- **Python**: While not exclusively an OOP language, Python supports OOP principles and is known for its easy-to-read syntax, making it a popular choice for teaching and implementing OOP concepts.\n",

But when software systems get larger and lerger, we need architectures encompasing paradigms such as OOP that don't increase exponentially in complexity in relation to the size of our codebase. With all that in mind this challenge task is a great way to try a understand the fundamentals of OOP. It does however, get considerably more complex then this example in the real world...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Design and implement a Vehicle Management System in Python using Object-Oriented Programming, focusing on inheritance. This system should manage different types of vehicles, each with unique attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Detailed Specifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ** Class Vehicle (Base Class)**\n",
    "   - **Attributes**: \n",
    "     - `make` (string): Brand of the vehicle.\n",
    "     - `model` (string): Model of the vehicle.\n",
    "     - `year` (int): Year of manufacture.\n",
    "   - **Methods**:\n",
    "     - `vehicle_info()`: Returns a formatted string like \"Make: [make], Model: [model], Year: [year]\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inherited Vehicle Subclasses**\n",
    "   - **Car Subclass**:\n",
    "     - Additional Attribute: `number_of_doors` (int).\n",
    "     - Override `vehicle_info()`: Include door information in the returned string.\n",
    "   - **Truck Subclass**:\n",
    "     - Additional Attribute: `cargo_capacity` (float, in kilograms).\n",
    "     - Override `vehicle_info()`: Include cargo capacity in the returned string.\n",
    "   - **Motorcycle Subclass**:\n",
    "     - Additional Attribute: `has_sidecar` (boolean).\n",
    "     - Override `vehicle_info()`: Include sidecar information in the returned string.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **VehicleManager Class**\n",
    "   - **Attributes**: \n",
    "     - `vehicles` (list): Stores instances of `Vehicle` and its subclasses.\n",
    "   - **Methods**:\n",
    "     - `add_vehicle(vehicle)`: Adds a new vehicle instance to the `vehicles` list.\n",
    "     - `remove_vehicle(make, model)`: Removes a vehicle by make and model. Returns True if successful, False otherwise.\n",
    "     - `list_vehicles()`: Returns a list of strings, each representing the information of a vehicle in the system.\n",
